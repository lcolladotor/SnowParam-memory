Here were the 4 jobs I followed:

From the system side, there were wildly different numbers...

For Snow 3.1, there were 10 R processes, each reporting 0.48 GB of RAM
(that's half a GB), and one R process using 6.1GB

For Mulicore 3.1 there were 10 R processes, each reporting 4.1GB of RAM,
and one R process using 6.1GB

For Snow 3.2, there were 10 R processes, each reporting 3.4 GB of RAM, and
one R process using 6.1GB
For Mulicore 3.2 there were 10 R processes, each reporting 6.6 GB of RAM,
and one R process using 6.1GB





I checked the system "shared memory" with the "ipcs" command, and none of
the system were using the Linux Shared Memory... so it must be implemented
in another way...

I'm really curious why the Snow 3.1 used so much less memroy.  It also
took a lot, lot longer to run... and is still running.

The maxvmem numbers pretty closely reflect what I was seeing

For Snow 3.1,-  11.6GB
For Mulicore 3.1 - 71.390G (when I watched this, the R processes were
using only 4.1GB, but must have jumped up to 6GB at some point)
For Snow 3.2, - 42.980G
For Mulicore 3.2 - 75.322G

So, I guess in summary, my observations on the system seem to reflect what
the cluster is reporting back for memory usage of each process.
